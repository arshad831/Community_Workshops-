        "\n",
        "The memory allows a _\"agent\"_ to remember previous interactions with the user. By default, agents are *stateless* — meaning each incoming query is processed independently of other interactions. The only thing that exists for a stateless agent is the current input, nothing else.\n",

It is based on the concept of a _knowledge graph_ which recognizes different entities and connects them in pairs with a predicate resulting in (subject, predicate, object) triplets. This enables us to compress a lot of information into highly significant snippets that can be fed into the model as context. If you want to understand this memory type in more depth you can check out [this](https://apex974.com/articles/explore-langchain-support-for-knowledge-graph) blogpost."
