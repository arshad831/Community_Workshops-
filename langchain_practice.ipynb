These AI systems function as agents, meaning they can perceive their environment, process inputs, and execute actions that affect their surroundings. The concept of agentic AI often includes the following characteristics:\\n\\n1. **Autonomy**: The ability to operate independently without constant human oversight. Agentic AI can make its own decisions based on predefined criteria or learned experiences.\\n\\n2. **Goal-oriented behavior**: These systems are typically programmed to achieve specific objectives or complete tasks, and they can adjust their actions based on feedback to improve their performance over time.\\n\\n3. **Adaptability**: Agentic AI can learn from its environment and experiences, adapting to new situations and challenges by utilizing machine learning techniques.\\n\\n4. **Interactivity**: These AI agents can communicate and collaborate with humans or other agents, sharing information and making joint decisions when necessary.\\n\\n5. **Perception and Decision-making**: They possess the ability to interpret data from their surroundings using sensors or other inputs and use that information to inform their actions.\\n\\nAgentic AI is used in a variety of applications, including robotics, autonomous vehicles, virtual assistants, and more complex systems like those used in strategic gameplay or automated trading.
